# main asset code base
# Vision
# Keep it simple and clear, focus on one rock at a time.
# first setup futures backtester cradle to grave.
# Equity system with trend, carry and 1 macro indicator signal
# then pick up the signal and put it to the backtester
# alongside all the output stats etc needed to make the decision.
# Need to build an optimiser which can do rolling and with added priors.
# will need to produce a rolling/recursive regression model which can take many inputs with constraints. Make it flexible.
# Plan Equity
# build trend class and ensure you have a test file that actually checks the data and signals.
# How will the equity system pick up and print this information?
